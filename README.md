Project Name: Reel Pick

Description: This web app allows users to select a movie genre and generates three random movies that match that genre. Each movie is displayed with its title and poster, giving users a fast, visual way to explore film options. This project was built to strengthen my understanding of API integration and dynamic DOM manipulation.

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Challenges: Randomizing movie results while keeping the display consistent

Updating the DOM in a clean and efficient way
